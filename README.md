#  Rock - Paper - Scissors Game

##  What is this project all about?
This is the rock-paper-scissors game we're all familiar with, the computer will select its move whenever you click any of the rock, paper or scissors buttons to choose your move if you win then the background of the display will change to green and your win count will be updated and the same will happen for if you lose (background, in this case, will turn to red and lose will increment) or there is a draw (background, in this case, will turn to yellow and draw will increment) between you and the computer.
